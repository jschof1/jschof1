# Well, hello there 🤓


I like building things from scratch – websites, ideas, and occasionally flat-pack furniture (with mixed results). With a background in philosophy, a love of music, and training in counselling, I’ve learned to do the overthinking so others don’t have to. The goal is always the same: to create things that make life better.
